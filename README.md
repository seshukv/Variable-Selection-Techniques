<h1>Variable Selection Techniques</h1>

<h3>Project Description</h3>
The Variable Selection Techniques project aims to compare three popular variable selection methods: backward elimination, forward selection, and stepwise selection. These techniques are applied to the same dataset to create predictive models. The models generated using these methods are then evaluated and compared based on several performance metrics, including adjusted R-squared, root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). The goal is to identify the best model that provides the most accurate predictions.
